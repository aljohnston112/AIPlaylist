          A group of media is picked from using a probability function, 
          that can be adjusted, to decide the media to play

          Known Issues
          ------------
          1) You have to click the media player for it to take in keyboard events
          2) Window size resets on start
          3) If you change the file structure, the program will not update until you restart the program
             Note: The probabilities will get reset if the file structure is changed
          
          Tutorial
          --------
          Pick a folder with supported media files (mp4, 3gp, asf, wmv, au, avi, flv, mov, ogm, ogg, 
                                                    mkv, mka, ts, mpg, mp3, mp2, nsc, nsv, nut, ra, 
                                                    ram, rm, rv, rmbv, a52, dts, aac, flac, dv, vid, 
                                                    tta, tac, ty, wav, dts, xa)
          Use period(.) to increase the probability of the current media playing in the future
          Use comma(,) to decrease the probability of the current media playing in the future
          Use right(->) to play the next media
          Use left(<-) to play the previous media
          Use (p) to reset probabilities
          Use (l) to loop 
          Use (r) to repeat
